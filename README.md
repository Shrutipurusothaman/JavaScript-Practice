# JavaScript 7 day DOM challenge
## Document Object Model(DOM):
+ DOM is an interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML elements dynamically.
+ When a web page loads:
  1. The browser converts HTML into a tree of objects.
  2. JavaScript uses this tree to read, change, add, or remove elements.
